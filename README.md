# Plantr - Grow Nurture Thrive

## The problem
When I garden I find it difficult to remember important information.

When did I plant that spinach? Did I water those cauliflower yesterday or the day before? How long ago did I plant those carrots?

## The right information.
## Right when you need it.

Plantr is a web application built to help you grow your vegetables. It's like a todo list for your plants.

Except it's a smart todo list, that will give you an estimate of when plants are ready to harvest.  It will also keep track of when you watered your plants and will remind you to water them at a set interval of days.

## For New Zealanders

Sorry if you're not based in NZ! Plantr is specifically targetted for New Zealand seasons and climates. It uses advice from the best New Zealand-based resources to give you estimates of when to plant.

## Is this hosted somewhere?

Yeah. You can find [Plantr hosted on Heroku ](https://plantr-nz.herokuapp.com/)
